## Introduction Draft 1

The English Premier League is considered one of the most exciting soccer leagues in all of the world making Premier League games some of the most watched cable events in the world. Like other mainstream sporting leagues, the Premier League attracts significant attention from the gaming industry. Currently, predicting the victor of a Premier League match with high certainty is very difficult...as of now. We, as a group, will attempt to construct a comprehensive neural network to successfully predict the result of Premier League matches on a consistent basis.

To improve upon the previous [results](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-9509-7_57), we will try to use a more robust dataset with more pre-game and post-game datapoints such as expected goals for and against along with a more optimized algorithm. Another key modification is that their results are outdated and do not continue to learn, whereas we want to keep our model as up to date as possible. This might mean reading data in from the last 3-4 years instead of the last 7-8 years. 

Ideally, we would like to have an algorithm that can accurately predict the result upwards of 70% of the time. A key challenge is understanding exactly what datapoints matter the most and what matter the least. This is difficult to predict beforehand and trial and error with different sets of datapoints might lead us to improved algorithms. 

We acknowledge that predicting the result of a Premier League match is a very difficult problem, but we hope to succeed and improve on previous results. Ultimately, we would like to test our data on the current set of ongoing premier league matches to determine the success rate of our algorithm. A lot of factors can change as the form of teams changes throughout the season, but we are confident that we can build a strong model. 

If we are able to build a successful model, we realise that it might lead to an increase in the amount of bets made on Premier League matches, leading to those consequences faced by excessive gambling. For one, the number of bets might drastically increase with people taking higher risks. Clearly, if people are aware of the result of the game from beforehand for about 70% of the time, there is a lot of money to be made. Another issue that might surface is a lack of enjoyment in watching football. If people know the result beforehand, would they still enjoy watching the game as much? These are some questions and consequences we need to consider if we end up building a successful model. 

## Related Works Draft 1

Due to the high demand and market for sports betting and the surrounding fan anticipation/engagement, there have been several previous studies on the prediction of sporting events using neural networks. While much of the work produced to predict soccer outcomes has been adapted from the prediction of other sporting events, such as those of NBA and NFL games, the following papers have provided essential and extensive background knowledge on our topic for soccer matches, some of which focus entirely on the English Premier League, just as we do in our study. Here, we outline the main contributions of these works and explain the nuances and points of expansion that our study focuses on. 

The primary source and motivation for our project comes from a study done by Sarika, et al. titled [“Soccer Result Prediction Using Deep Learning and Neural Networks”](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-9509-7_57).  This study compares several different prior sport outcome predictors and constructs their own in the form of an RNN (recurrent neural network). Using data from the 2011-2017 seasons of the EPL, Sarika and his colleagues trained their model to accurately predict EPL match outcomes up to 80% of the time. Sarika and his team used LSTM (long, short-term memory) cells composed of three gates: forget gates, input gates, and output gates. We use this architecture as our main source of motivation to produce an even higher accuracy model for EPL game outcomes.

Another key piece of research for our project comes from Wagenaar et al. in their paper [“Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to Predict Goal-scoring Opportunities in Soccer”](https://www.ai.rug.nl/~mrolarik/Publications/ICPRAM_2017_67.pdf). This paper uses two-dimensional image data to predict the chance of a goal-scoring opportunity based on the location of the ball and players relative to each other and each team’s goal. By using a CNN architecture, Wagenaar and his team were able to accurately predict the chance of a goal being scored given a snapshot of the field 67.1% of the time. Notably, this paper uses training data from the Bundesliga, but it still provides pertinent and helpful information on how snapshots of game positions might aid the prediction of overall soccer match score-lines and outcomes as we aim to improve upon with our study.

Predicting soccer games using neural nets is still a relatively niche field and remains mostly under researched. We found one example of a statistical method done by Benedikt Droste in his article, ["Predict soccer matches with 50% accuracy"](https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-soccer-matches-with-50-accuracy-a24cc8078877), using the Poisson distribution and the Poisson Regression in python. He first created a Poisson distribution to fit farely well with most of the match results in the 2018 -2019 premier league season and proceeded to predict the results of the last 10 matches of the same season using the Poisson Regression. The predictions achieved a near 50% accuracy. To enhance the predictions, the regression took into account key data points for each team such as the likelihood that they would score, the likelihood that they would concede and the likelihood that they would score if they were a home or away team. Moreover, the author suggests looking into more data points such as team form, more matches and correctness of under/over underestimating results to make it better. Similarly, with an attention to key match factors, we found a 2018 research paper titled ["Football Match Statistics Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks"](https://www.iaras.org/iaras/filedownloads/ijmcm/2018/001-0001(2018).pdf), by Sujatha et al, where they argue that for any two teams in contention, correctly predicting the outcome of a match involves paying attention to key factors including current team league rank, league points, the UEFA coefficient, home and away goals scored/conceded, team cost, home wins/loses, away wins/loses, home advantage e.t.c. In their research, they pit two Bundesliga teams (Bayern Munich and Dortmund) against each other, and trained a neural net with inputs for each team based on the key factors. They were able to predict outcomes of multiple matches between the two teams with relatively high accuracy (percentages not provided) and in some cases did better when compared to bookie odds.

From our research, we note that neural nets generally do better than available statistical methods in predicting match outcomes. Given the availability of a large volume of premier league data, we plan on coming up with a proper classification of key data points and training a neural net that can predict a winning team through percentage chance or number of expected goals.  


## Literature Review

### 1. Soccer Result Prediction Using Deep Learning and Neural Networks
This paper compares several different score/outcome prediction strategies for various sports and leagues (including the NBA and soccer matches) and proposes an RNN (recuring neural network) architecture to predict match outcomes in the English Premier League. Taking as parameters a team's statistics from past seasons (and updating data by adding current games of a season) the RNN constructed in this paper ended up with around an 80% accuracy prediction of match outcomes. Some parameters included were points gained by the home vs. away team (1 for draw, 3 for win, 0 for loss), goals scored by the home vs. away team, winning and losing streak of the home vs. away team (a streak of >3 and >5 were tracked). This paper concludes that RNNs provide a better architecture for the problem of score prediction over other architectures and provide measurable evidence for such in soccer matches in the EPL. 

### 2. Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to Predict Goal-scoring Opportunities in Soccer
This paper trained a NN on Bundesliga game data to predict the chance of a goal scoring opportunity based on a given position of the game's players and the game ball. Using 2-dimensional data gathered from the Amisco multi-camera system, this network showed as a high as a 67% accuracy rate for predicting goals. This paper coul be helpful if we wanted to analyze past scoring chances, positional data, and etc... from past games played by a team in order to provide a prediction of current and future game outcomes.

### 3. Predict soccer matches with 50% accuracy
In the article, the author used the Poisson Distribution and Poisson Regression through Python to predict the results of the last 10 matches of the 2018-2019 Premier League season. It was quite clear to see that for that season at least, the Poisson distribution very clearly matched the results of the whole season. The key data points he used were, for a certain team, the likelihood that they would score, the likelihood that they would concede and the likelihoods that they would score if they were a home or away team. It resulted in a success rate of almost 50%. The author also suggested using more data points such as form, more matches and correctness of under/over underestimating results.

### 4. Football Match Statistics Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks
This paper discusses a soccer match statistics prediction NN framwork. The NN is trained with data from two Bundesliga teams (Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmound). They analyze various input factors selected to help the Neural Net detect patterns and predict match statisitics such as the winning team, goals scored, and bookings. Their data shows that the Neural Net is able to predict the match statistics with a higher accuracy than an existing if-else case framework (Football Result Expert System (FRES) used to predict American soccer. According to their analysis, there are several key factors which affect the outcome of matches and a NN can be trained to learn from previous history to predict future outcomes. These factors include: transfer money spent by a team in a season, a team's UEFA co-effecient (for each team participating in the champions league), year of match, league rank, goals scored and conceded,  wins and losses , home advantage etc. They advice that each of these factors have certain limitations in their application and some teams generally have more data than others because of their length of participation in competitions. A few of these factors can also only be applied within a league in a single country. This paper could be useful to help guide our choices when considering the type of data we need for teams and also the labels we need to train a NN. In addition, we can learn from their backpropagation algorithm and normalization of data points for further improvement. 

## Project Update 1

### Software
We will use a combination of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/). 

### Our Dataset
We will use a combination of ["English Premier League stats 2019-2020"](https://www.kaggle.com/idoyo92/epl-stats-20192020?select=epl2020.csv), ["2021-2022 Premier League Stats"](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats) and ["English Premier League (football)"](https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league#readme).

### Overview of project
We want to use a recurrent neural network along with long short-term memory since we want to keep track of patterns and form. Our inputs will be a vector of floating point values (expected goals for and expected goals against for the home team for the particular game). We will be performing classification. Our algorithm will predict the most probable scoreline out of a multitude of options. Hence, our output will be a vector of floating point values that hold the probablility of the match ending in a given scoreline. 

## Project Update 2
What we have completed or tried to complete:
* We have conclusively decided our final project goal which is to predict the result of an English Premier League (EPL) soccer match.
  * This was changed from predicting the scoreline of an EPL soccer match. 
* We will likely use the dataset ["English Premier League (football)"](https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league#readme). 
  * The dataset only contains data till the 18-19 season, so we might have to train our data using the old data and test it on season 19-20. 
  * The dataset also contains a lot of irrelevant information that we will have to remove. 
* Completed our introduction and related works sections. 

Issues we have encountered:
* Finding a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset containing relevant data from at least the last 4 seasons. 
* Understanding exactly what data we need for our project.
  * We feel as though it might require trial and error and we might have to test the neural network with different datasets. 

Addressing Hypothesis comments: 
1. We have changed our project goal from predicting the soccer scoreline to predicting the result of the game. For this, we want to use an RNN since that has had the most success in the past. We also thought it made sense because it allows the network to remember previous results and hence take into consideration the form of the team.
2. We are currently doing that and are taking a look at how to do it in PyTorch. 
3. We have formatted the links and updated the document for our introduction draft. 
4. We have added links in a consistent format for our introduction and related works draft. 
5. We briefly discussed the ethical implications of building a successful project in our last paragraph in our initial introduction outline. However, we have now added a more comprehensive discussion on it at the end our current introduction draft.
